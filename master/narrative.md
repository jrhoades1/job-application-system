# Personal Narrative — Jimmy Rhoades

## Core Identity

Technical leadership at the intersection of healthcare and AI. Not a manager
who used to code — a builder who leads teams. 20+ years of scaling engineering
orgs from zero, shipping patient-facing products, and making healthcare systems
work better through technology.

## Differentiators

1. **Built from scratch, repeatedly.** Three separate teams built from inception
   (MedQuest 0→22, Red Spot 0→15, Perceptive 0→10). Not inheriting teams —
   recruiting, hiring, and building culture from nothing.

2. **Healthcare is not a side gig.** Entire career in healthtech — EHR systems,
   HIPAA compliance, claims processing, diagnostic imaging, value-based care.
   Deep domain knowledge, not a tech generalist who "also does healthcare."

3. **AI before it was trendy.** Integrated AI/ML into healthcare workflows
   before GPT made it mainstream. Real production systems, not proof-of-concepts.

4. **Business-aligned technologist.** Multi-quarter roadmaps, $2M budgets,
   client base growth, revenue impact. Speaks the language of the business,
   not just the stack.

## Tone Guidelines

- Confident but not arrogant. Let the numbers speak.
- Specific over vague. "50K to 90K beneficiaries" not "significant growth."
- Active voice. "Led" not "was responsible for."
- Avoid buzzword soup. If a sentence could describe anyone, rewrite it.
- Show the trajectory: individual contributor → architect → director → CTO.

## Themes to Emphasize by Role Type

### CTO / VP Engineering
- Team building from zero, multiple times
- Strategic roadmap development tied to business outcomes
- AI integration as competitive advantage
- Budget ownership and resource alignment

### Director of Engineering
- Hands-on technical leadership with team scaling
- Agile transformation and velocity improvement
- Cross-functional collaboration with product and ops
- DevOps and CI/CD institutionalization

### Chief Architect / Principal Engineer
- Monolith-to-microservices transformation
- Healthcare interoperability (HL7, FHIR, DICOM)
- Cloud architecture across AWS and Azure
- Performance optimization with measurable latency reduction

## What NOT to Say

- Don't undersell the scope. 100 centers in 13 states is enterprise scale.
- Don't bury the AI work. It's a differentiator, lead with it when relevant.
- Don't be generic about "passion for technology." Show it through the
  rongorongo project — that's genuine intellectual curiosity, not a resume line.
