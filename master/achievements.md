# Achievement Inventory — Jimmy Rhoades

> Source of truth for quantified accomplishments. Skills reference this file
> when tailoring resumes to specific job descriptions. Update as new wins happen.
>
> **How this file grows:** Items from the original resume have no tag. Items
> discovered through conversation are tagged `[learned: YYYY-MM-DD]` so you
> can see what was added and when. The learning loop in the job-intake skill
> adds entries here automatically when the candidate provides new information
> during a job evaluation. All entries — original and learned — are equally
> valid for matching against job requirements.
