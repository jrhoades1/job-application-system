# Career Narrative

Your positioning guide. The skills use this to maintain a consistent voice across
resumes, cover letters, and interview prep.

## Core Identity

Write 2-3 sentences that capture who you are professionally. Not a job title — your
story. What makes your career arc distinctive?

Example: "Technical leadership at the intersection of healthcare and AI. Not a manager
who used to code — a builder who leads teams."

## Differentiators

What sets you apart? List 3-4 things that most candidates in your target roles don't have.

1. **[Differentiator 1]** — Brief explanation
2. **[Differentiator 2]** — Brief explanation
3. **[Differentiator 3]** — Brief explanation

## Tone Guidelines

How should your materials sound?

- Confident but not arrogant; let numbers speak
- Specific over vague ("50K to 90K beneficiaries" not "significant growth")
- Active voice, avoid buzzwords

## Role-Type Themes

For each type of role you're targeting, what themes should the skills emphasize?

### [Target Role Type 1, e.g., CTO/VP Engineering]
- Theme A
- Theme B
- Theme C

### [Target Role Type 2, e.g., Director of Engineering]
- Theme A
- Theme B
- Theme C

## What NOT to Say

Things the skills should avoid in your materials:

- Don't undersell [specific scope]
- Don't bury [specific strength]
- Don't be generic about [specific topic]
