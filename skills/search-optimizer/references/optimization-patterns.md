# Optimization Patterns

## Strategy Frameworks

### Source Reallocation Matrix

| Source | Low conversion (<10%) | Medium (10-30%) | High (>30%) |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Referral** | Unusual — check if referrals are warm enough | Good baseline | Invest heavily |
| **LinkedIn** | Common for cold applies — reduce effort | Maintain | Scale up |
| **Direct** | Check if resume/letter are strong enough | Good | Scale up |
| **Recruiter** | May be wrong recruiters — quality over quantity | Maintain relationship | Ask for more leads |

### Match Score Strategy

| Pattern | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Strong matches convert reliably (>50%) | Focus here. This is your sweet spot. |
| Good matches convert moderately (20-40%) | Worth the effort. Invest in tailoring. |
| Stretch matches rarely convert (<10%) | Limit to dream companies only. Don't spray-and-pray. |
| Long shots never convert | Stop unless you have an inside connection. |

### Rejection Pattern Response

| Pattern (3+ occurrences) | Response |
|--------------------------|----------|
| "No experience in X" but you have X | Resume isn't showcasing it. Restructure. |
| "No experience in X" and you truly don't | Remove this role type from targets or invest in skill. |
| "Salary expectations too high" | Adjust range or target different company tier. |
| "Internal hire selected" | Not actionable — don't change strategy based on this. |
| "No reason given" | Not actionable individually. Look at other patterns. |
| "Overqualified" | Target higher-level roles or different company stage. |

### Pipeline Health Targets

| Metric | Healthy | Concerning | Critical |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| Active applications (applied + interviewing) | 5-10 | 3-4 | <3 |
| New applications per week | 2-4 | 1 | 0 |
| Days since last new application | <7 | 7-14 | >14 |
| Average days in "applied" before response | <21 | 21-35 | >35 |

### Velocity Guidance

For a CTO/VP-level candidate:
- These are low-volume, high-touch roles. Quality over quantity.
- 2-3 well-targeted applications per week is a healthy pace.
- Each application should take 1-2 hours (skill chain handles most of the work).
- Follow up at 10-14 days, not 7 (executive hiring moves slower).
- Don't apply to more than 2 stretch roles per week — save energy for strong matches.

## Recommendation Templates

### "Your referrals are gold"
"Your data shows referral applications convert to interviews at [X]x the rate of
cold applications. Recommendation: Spend 60% of your weekly job search time
building and leveraging your network rather than submitting cold applications.
Specific contacts to reach out to: [names from achievements.md companies]."

### "Strong matches are your path"
"With a [X]% conversion rate on strong matches versus [Y]% on stretch matches,
the data is clear: focus on roles where your experience maps directly. You can
afford to be selective — apply only to strong and good matches unless a stretch
role is at a top-5 target company."

### "Your resume is hiding something"
"Three companies asked about [X] in interviews, but it's buried in your resume
under [section]. Recommendation: Move [X] experience into your professional
summary and add a dedicated bullet under [relevant role]. The market is telling
you this skill matters."
