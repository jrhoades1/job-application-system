# Tailoring Patterns — Examples by Intensity

## Light tailoring (strong match)

The resume already fits well. Small targeted adjustments.

### Keyword injection
**Job asks for:** "value-based care"
**Resume currently says:** "Expanded beneficiary coverage from 50,000 to 90,000"
**Tailored:** "Expanded beneficiary coverage from 50,000 to 90,000 through value-based care initiatives"

The addition is truthful (the work was in value-based care) and hits the keyword
without changing the substance.

### Skills reordering
**Job emphasizes:** AWS, FHIR, Python, Kubernetes
**Current skills order:** Python, Java, C#, NodeJS, SQL | AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
**Tailored order:** Python, Java, NodeJS, C# | AWS, Azure | Kubernetes, CI/CD, Microservices

AWS and Python move to prominent positions. Technologies not mentioned in the job
don't disappear — they just move down.

### Section bullet reordering
**Job emphasizes:** team scaling and AI integration
**Current first bullet (ilumed):** "Overhauled system architecture for HIPAA compliance"
**Move to first position:** "Spearheaded AI/ML integration into healthcare workflows"

The HIPAA bullet is still there, just not leading. The recruiter's first impression
now matches what they're looking for.

## Moderate tailoring (good match)

Keyword injection plus strategic additions and repositioning.

### Pull from achievements.md
**Job asks for:** "CI/CD and DevOps experience"
**Base resume:** doesn't mention CI/CD prominently
**achievements.md has:** "Instituted DevOps and CI/CD practices, improving reliability
by 35% and deployment frequency by 50% (Red Spot)"
**Action:** Add this bullet to the Red Spot section of the tailored resume.

This is experience the candidate has but didn't prioritize on the base resume. For
this specific job, it matters.

### Reframe partial matches
**Job asks for:** "experience with GCP"
**Candidate has:** extensive AWS and Azure experience
**Tailored summary adjustment:** "Cloud architecture across AWS, Azure, and emerging
platforms" — acknowledges the multi-cloud experience and signals adaptability without
claiming GCP specifically.

### Strengthen the summary
**Job is for:** Director of Engineering
**narrative.md themes for Director:** Hands-on technical leadership, agile transformation,
cross-functional collaboration, DevOps institutionalization
**Tailored summary:** Incorporate these themes, pulling specific numbers from
achievements.md: "Engineering leader with 20+ years building healthcare technology
teams from inception, driving agile transformation that increased velocity by 15%,
and instituting DevOps practices that improved deployment frequency by 50%."

## Heavy tailoring (stretch match)

Significant restructuring to maximize apparent fit.

### Reorder roles by relevance
**Job is for:** Chief Architect focused on microservices and cloud migration
**Most relevant role:** Cognizant (managed 50+ devs, microservices transformation,
cloud architecture)
**Most recent role:** ilumed CTO (AI/healthcare, less architecture-focused)

**Option A — Relevant Experience split:**
```
RELEVANT EXPERIENCE
Chief Technology Architect — Cognizant  (2015-2019)
...

ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE
Chief Technology Officer — ilumed  (2022-Present)
...
```

**Option B — Keep chronological but expand relevant, compress less relevant:**
Cognizant section gets 5-6 bullets with full detail. ilumed section gets 2-3
bullets focused on any architecture-adjacent work.

Option B is generally safer — Option A can look like you're hiding things.

### Rewrite the professional summary entirely
For stretch matches, the generic summary won't cut it. Write a targeted summary
that directly addresses the job's top 3-4 requirements with evidence:

"Chief Technology Architect with 20+ years leading large-scale cloud migrations
for Fortune 500 healthcare clients. Transformed monolithic platforms into
microservices architectures, led teams of 50+ across global delivery centers, and
drove HL7/FHIR interoperability initiatives improving data accuracy by 15%.
Deep expertise in AWS and Azure with multi-tenant SaaS design."

Every clause maps to a specific requirement from the job posting.

### Surface buried experience
Dig into achievements.md for anything that addresses gaps. If the job asks for
"budget ownership of $5M+" and the resume shows "$2M annual budget" at MedQuest,
check if there's a learned entry with a higher figure, or if combining budget
responsibility across roles tells a bigger story.

## Former employer (any match score)

Use light intensity. The candidate's track record at this company is already known.

### What to adjust
- Lead the summary with "Returning to [Company] with expanded scope in [new area]"
- Emphasize what the candidate has done SINCE leaving — growth, new skills, broader
  experience that makes them a stronger candidate now than when they left
- De-emphasize the experience AT that company (they already know about it) and
  highlight what's new

### What not to do
- Don't over-tailor. It can look like you're trying too hard for a place that
  already knows your work.
- Don't ignore the elephant in the room — the resume should make it obvious this is
  a return, not hide it.

## General principles across all intensities

**One page is the goal.** For 15+ years of experience, two pages is acceptable but
not preferred. Every line needs to earn its space. When adding bullets from
achievements.md, remove or shorten less relevant ones to maintain length.

**Quantify everything.** "Led team" → "Led team of 22 engineers." "Improved
performance" → "Reduced latency by 20%." The achievements.md inventory is already
quantified — use those numbers.

**Match their language.** If the posting says "engineering manager" and the candidate's
title was "director of engineering," keep the actual title but use their terminology
in descriptions. "Directed engineering teams" → "Led engineering organization" if that's
closer to their language.

**Don't sacrifice truth for fit.** Repositioning experience is fine. Reframing is fine.
Inventing experience or inflating numbers is not. Every claim must trace to either
the base resume or achievements.md.
