# Offer Evaluation Framework

## Decision Scorecard

Rate each factor 1-5 and weight by personal importance:

| Factor | Weight (1-3) | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Compensation** | | | |
| Base salary vs market | 3 | | |
| Total comp (base + bonus + equity) | 3 | | |
| Benefits quality | 1 | | |
| **Role** | | | |
| Scope and impact | 3 | | |
| Title and seniority | 2 | | |
| Team size and quality | 2 | | |
| **Growth** | | | |
| Career trajectory | 3 | | |
| Learning opportunity | 2 | | |
| Company growth stage | 2 | | |
| **Practical** | | | |
| Location / remote fit | 2 | | |
| Commute / travel | 1 | | |
| Work-life balance signals | 2 | | |
| **Risk** | | | |
| Company stability | 2 | | |
| Team/leadership stability | 2 | | |
| Role clarity | 1 | | |

**Scoring guide:**
- 5 = Exceptional, exceeds expectations
- 4 = Strong, meets expectations well
- 3 = Acceptable, meets minimum requirements
- 2 = Below expectations, but workable
- 1 = Dealbreaker territory

**Interpretation:**
- Weighted total > 80% of max: Strong offer, lean accept
- Weighted total 60-80% of max: Good offer, negotiate the weak areas
- Weighted total < 60% of max: Significant concerns, consider declining

## Negotiation Principles

### The ask should be specific
Bad: "I was hoping for more money."
Good: "Based on the scope of this role and my experience, I was hoping we could
discuss a base salary of $X, which reflects [rationale]."

### Lead with enthusiasm
Always open with genuine excitement about the role before the ask. They need
to feel you want the job — just that you want fair terms.

### Give them a way to say yes
Offer flexibility: "Whether that's through base, signing bonus, or equity,
I'm open to how we get there." This lets them find budget where they have it.

### Know your walk-away number
Before negotiating, decide the minimum total comp you'd accept. Below that
number, you're better off continuing the search.

### Don't negotiate against yourself
State your ask once. Don't immediately follow with "but I'd also be okay with..."
Let them respond first.

## Common Negotiation Scenarios

### "The offer is at the top of the range"
Counter: "I understand the range constraint. Could we discuss a signing bonus to
bridge the gap, or an accelerated review at 6 months with a clear path to [level]?"

### "We can't move on base salary"
Counter: "I understand. What flexibility do we have on [equity / signing bonus /
title / remote days / start date / review timeline]?"

### "Take it or leave it"
Assessment: This is rare at senior levels and may be a red flag. If the number
works, accept. If it doesn't, be willing to walk.

### "We have other candidates"
Assessment: This is a negotiation tactic. If they made you an offer, they want
you. Maintain your ask politely. "I appreciate that. I believe my [specific
experience] makes me uniquely qualified for [specific challenge], and I'd love
to find a number that works for both of us."

## Equity Evaluation

### Public company stock (RSUs)
- Value is relatively known (current price × shares)
- Vesting typically 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Calculate annual value: total grant ÷ 4
- Consider: stock price trajectory, refresh grants

### Pre-IPO / startup equity
- Much harder to value. Use: last valuation × your % ownership
- Apply a 50-75% discount for illiquidity and risk
- Key questions: preferred vs common shares, exercise price, 409A valuation,
  liquidation preferences, secondary market availability
- Vesting: same 4-year/1-year cliff is standard

### Equity as negotiation lever
Easier for companies to give equity than cash because:
- It doesn't affect current cash burn
- It signals belief in the company's future
- It aligns incentives

## Response Email Templates

### Accepting
"Thank you, [Name]. I'm excited to accept the [Role] position at [Company].
The updated terms — [summarize key points] — work well, and I'm looking forward
to contributing to [specific goal discussed in interviews]. Please send over the
formal offer letter and any paperwork I should complete before [start date]."

### Declining
"Thank you for the offer for the [Role] position. After careful consideration,
I've decided to pursue another opportunity that aligns more closely with my
current career goals. I've genuinely enjoyed getting to know the team and
learning about [specific thing]. I hope we can stay in touch."

### Asking for more time
"Thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the [Role] position and want
to give it the consideration it deserves. Would it be possible to have until
[date] to make my decision? I want to make sure I'm fully committed when I
say yes."
