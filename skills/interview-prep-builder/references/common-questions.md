## Behavioral Question Frameworks

For behavioral questions, use the STAR method with emphasis on numbers:

**Situation:** 1-2 sentences setting the context
**Task:** What was your specific responsibility
**Action:** What you did (be specific about YOUR contribution)
**Result:** Quantified impact (from achievements.md)

Keep each answer to 2-3 minutes. The interviewer will ask follow-ups if they
want more detail.

## Questions to Ask (Universal)

These work across role types and always impress:

1. "What's the biggest challenge the team is facing that this role would help solve?"
2. "How does the team approach [methodology mentioned in job description]?"
3. "What does a successful first 90 days look like?"
4. "How does engineering interact with [product/clinical/business] teams?"
5. "What's the company's approach to technical debt?"
6. "Where do you see this team in 18 months?"

Avoid: salary (save for recruiter/HR), benefits, vacation time (wait for offer stage).
