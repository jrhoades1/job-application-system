of AAUP members surveyed reported that their colleges and universities have introduced initiatives around uses of AI, yet these initiatives have not materialized into clear policies on AI implementation and use.¹
A growing number of universities are creating the Chief AI Officer role to coordinate how artificial intelligence is used across teaching, research, administration, and campus policy.²
Dynamic Campus partners with senior leadership to establish the
strategy, governance, and decision frameworks
required to adopt AI responsibly, ethically, and in alignment with institutional mission.
This is not technology implementation.
It is a guided, strategic path forward
with a trusted advisor who protects and advances your mission.
Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping teaching, learning, research, and operations across higher education
Yet most institutions face a growing gap:
AI adoption is happening faster than governance
Responsibility is fragmented across IT, academic affairs, and compliance
Leadership lacks a clear framework for risk, readiness, and strategic value
Without dedicated leadership, AI creates uncertainty, introducing risk and inefficiency instead of
strategic advantage.
