Be Alert to Employment Scams
We have received reports of an employment scam where individuals are falsely representing themselves as BeOne HR representatives and conducting bogus “employment interviews” via email, including using videotaped answers on Flock, and ultimately requesting payment as a condition for receiving an offer of employment. Please be aware that BeOne and its subsidiaries do not conduct interviews in this manner and will never request payment as a condition for applying for a position or receiving an offer of employment. These scam operators may also ask for your personal information, including your name, address, birthdate and Social Security number (SSN), which you should not share.
If you have been a target of such a scam, please report it to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (more details are available
here
), the office of your state Attorney General or the government agency responsible for investigating matters such as this where you reside.
Please be aware that BeOne and its subsidiaries
only communicate using email addresses ending in @beonemed.com.
Any communication from other domains is fraudulent.
