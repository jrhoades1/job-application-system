ChenMed
Miami, FL

Dear Hiring Manager,

ChenMed's mission of transforming healthcare for low-income seniors through value-based care is not an abstract concept to me — it is the work I do today. As CTO at ilumed, I lead the technology strategy for a value-based care provider, where I have expanded beneficiary coverage from 50,000 to 90,000 through platform architecture and AI-driven optimizations. I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Director, Software Engineering role, where I see a direct opportunity to bring that experience to a larger scale.

My career has been spent building software engineering organizations in healthcare from the ground up. I have built and scaled five engineering teams across my career, including a 22-person department at MedQuest, a 15-person team at Red Spot Interactive, and a 50+ developer organization across three countries at Cognizant Softvision. In each case, I established the delivery processes, talent development pipelines, and technical culture that enabled sustained execution — not just initial launch. On the technical side, my work has been anchored in the systems ChenMed cares about: AWS cloud architecture, microservices design that reduced latency by 20% across patient-facing platforms, CI/CD and DevOps practices that improved deployment frequency by 50%, and data protection frameworks including HIPAA compliance with 99.9% uptime and SOC2/HITRUST certification leadership. I have delivered large-scale platforms supporting 200,000+ appointments and 100 centers in 13 states, and I understand what it takes to build multi-year technology strategies that keep those systems competitive and cost-effective while managing technical debt.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in healthcare engineering leadership and AWS-based platform architecture could support ChenMed's technology strategy. The challenge of scaling software systems that directly improve care for underserved populations is exactly the kind of problem I have built my career around solving.

Sincerely,

Jimmy Rhoades
