A History of Driving the Industry Forward
We’ve been pioneering driverless technology since 2013 when we founded two of the world's first self-driving start-ups; nuTonomy and Ottomatika. Since then, we’ve provided over 130,000 autonomous rides with zero at-fault incidents. And we’re not stopping there.
