Flex

Dear Hiring Manager,

The problem Flex is solving — unlocking $150 billion in annual HSA/FSA spending for health and wellness brands — sits at a specific intersection I know well: healthcare compliance, payment workflows, and real-time eligibility verification. I have spent the past two decades building systems that process exactly these kinds of transactions, and the opportunity to lead engineering at a company turning that complexity into a seamless checkout experience is compelling.

At ilumed, I built the technology platform for a value-based care provider from the ground up, including automated eligibility processing that expanded coverage from 50,000 to 90,000 beneficiaries. At MedQuest, I automated insurance verification workflows that reduced errors by 60% across 100 centers. These are the same core problems Flex solves — verifying eligibility in real time, handling split determinations, and doing it at scale — applied in a different context. The engineering patterns are identical: backend systems that must be reliable, compliant, and fast enough that users never notice the complexity behind the checkout.

What I would bring beyond domain adjacency is a track record of building engineering teams from nothing in startup environments. I have done this three times — scaling to 22 at MedQuest, 15 at Red Spot Interactive, and 10 at Perceptive Solutions — each time establishing the hiring pipelines, engineering standards, DevOps practices, and delivery cadence that a growing company needs. At Red Spot, I architected a scheduling and payment platform on AWS that processed 200,000+ transactions and drove 40% revenue growth, while simultaneously instituting CI/CD practices that improved deployment frequency by 50%. I understand what it takes to build both the team and the infrastructure for the next stage of growth, which is exactly what this role requires.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience building compliant, high-throughput payment and eligibility systems — and the teams that ship them — could accelerate Flex's roadmap.

Sincerely,

Jimmy Rhoades
