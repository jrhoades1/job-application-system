Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability
Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form CC-305
OMB Control Number 1250-0005
Expires 04/30/2026
Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified
                                            people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we
                                            must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability
                                            or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.
Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who
                                            makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you
                                            want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance
