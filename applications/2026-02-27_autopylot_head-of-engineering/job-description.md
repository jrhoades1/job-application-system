FOR CRM
FRUSTRATION
Tracking sales activities, and gaining visibility into the sales motions, is a crucial, yet time-consuming and frustrating aspect of CRM systems.
That’s why we developed the AutoPylot platform. Learn how our mobile app automates data capture and enables Conversational AI for more intelligent sales actions.
SELL SMARTER, DRIVE SALES EFFICIENCY
Access to timely and accurate information about customer interactions, sales opportunities and action items is crucial.  But having salespeople spend hours a week keeping the CRM data current isn’t efficient. AutoPylot automates the collection of sales activity data – so salespeople have more time to sell.
32% OF SALES REPS
spend more than
one hour each day
on manual data entry.
AUTOMATE CRM DATA INPUT
Give your sales team more time to sell by automating data input. Capture calls, text and meeting notes automatically.
PUT YOUR DATA TO WORK
With more customer data comes better decision-making. Conversational AI analyzes auto-captured sales calls to help you and your company make better decisions.
SOLVE FOR COSTLY DATA LOSS
Use a dedicated number. No more using a personal mobile number for calls or texts. Good for salespeople, and good for the company.
CAPTURE, RECORD CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS
The AutoPylot platform provides detailed records of interactions. Enable call recording for record keeping, training purposes, or automatic call transcription. Plus, a log of text conversations makes capturing customer interaction easy.
