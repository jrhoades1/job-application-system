Hiring Team

Dear Hiring Manager,

The Head of Engineering role stands out because it sits at the intersection of what I have spent my career doing: building engineering organizations from scratch, delivering scalable SaaS platforms in regulated environments, and integrating AI into production workflows that drive measurable outcomes. The emphasis on personalized, research-driven experiences powered by modern engineering practices is exactly the kind of challenge I pursue.

In my most recent role as CTO at ilumed, I led the platform team that expanded user coverage from 50,000 to 90,000 while maintaining 99.9% uptime across cloud-native services. I drove the SOC2/HITRUST certification process, embedded compliance into engineering workflows, and partnered directly with Product and Data leadership to align our technical strategy with company objectives. Before that, as Chief Architect at Red Spot Interactive, I built the engineering team from zero to 15, designed a microservices architecture handling 200K+ transactions, and instituted the DevOps and CI/CD practices that improved deployment frequency by 50%. Across three organizations, I have built engineering teams from inception — recruiting talent, establishing culture, and scaling delivery across distributed time zones.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience scaling engineering organizations, delivering AI-enabled platforms, and operating in security-conscious environments aligns with your client's mission. I am available at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Jimmy Rhoades
