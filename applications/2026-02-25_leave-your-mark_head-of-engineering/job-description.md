## About the Job

The Head of Engineering is a senior technology leader responsible for building, scaling, and evolving our client's engineering organization across software, cloud, data, and developer platform teams. This role owns both how and what they build, advancing their mission to use AI and behavioral science to deliver highly personalized, scalable experiences that meet people where they are.

You will lead the delivery of product software and platforms—including microservices, web applications, data and analytics pipelines, and cloud-native services—that power enterprise clients and end users. You'll set a high bar for reliability, security, and quality while fostering a culture of continuous improvement, modern engineering practices, and developer productivity.

This role is ideal for a hands-on engineering leader who has scaled modern SaaS platforms, thrives in high-growth environments, and enjoys partnering closely with Product, Data, and Research teams.

## What You Will Do

### Engineering Leadership & Delivery

- Own execution of product and platform roadmaps, delivering measurable outcomes aligned to company OKRs.
- Lead the evolution of scalable SaaS and PaaS platforms through reusable services, APIs, and internal tooling.
- Partner closely with Product, Data, AI, and Behavioral Science leaders to align technical strategy with product vision and research-driven innovation.
- Establish and track engineering metrics (e.g., delivery velocity, reliability, uptime, quality) to drive operational excellence.
- Advance developer productivity through AI-assisted development, automation, and standardized tooling.
- Define and enforce consistent engineering processes, standards, and toolchains across teams.
- Collaborate with the CTO, Chief Architect, and Architecture Council to shape and operationalize long-term technical architecture.
- Oversee cloud governance, reliability, security, and cost optimization across environments.

### Technical Strategy & Platform Evolution

- Create and execute the company's technical strategy and engineering roadmap.
- Evaluate and adopt technologies that accelerate delivery, scalability, security, and AI-driven capabilities.
- Champion modern DevOps, CI/CD, automated testing, fault-tolerant system design, and secure-by-default practices.
- Embed privacy-by-design and strong data governance into engineering workflows and platforms.

### People Leadership & Culture

- Build and lead a high-performing, distributed engineering organization across multiple time zones.
- Develop and mentor engineering managers and senior technical leaders.
- Recruit, retain, and grow top engineering talent across software, data, and cloud disciplines.
- Own workforce planning, budgeting, and vendor/partner management.
- Lead and integrate both full-time and contract engineering resources.

### Hands-On Technical Leadership

- Serve as a senior technical leader on architecture and design initiatives.
- Contribute to complex technical decisions where deep system knowledge is required.
- Roll up your sleeves as needed—reviewing designs, validating approaches, or prototyping to accelerate progress.

## What You Need

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
- 10+ years of engineering experience, including several years in senior technical or people leadership roles.
- Proven experience building and scaling modern B2B and/or B2C production systems.
- Strong background in distributed systems, microservices architectures, cloud platforms (AWS and/or Azure), and DevOps practices.
- Experience leading teams using Agile development methodologies.
- Ability to partner effectively with executives and communicate clearly with technical and non-technical audiences.
- Experience managing distributed engineering teams across multiple time zones.

## Preferred / Differentiators

- Experience leading engineering teams in high-growth SaaS or platform companies.
- Experience building or deploying AI-enabled or data-driven systems.
- Experience operating in regulated, security-conscious, or high-trust environments (e.g., fintech, health tech, govtech, enterprise SaaS).
- Prior exposure to healthcare is a plus—but not required.
