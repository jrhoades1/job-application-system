SandboxAQ

Dear Hiring Manager,

SandboxAQ's mission to deliver AI-powered security solutions is compelling, and the Director of Product Engineering role in the Cybersecurity Group aligns directly with what I do best: building engineering teams from scratch, shipping complex production systems, and maintaining operational excellence in security-regulated environments. I have spent 20 years doing exactly this across organizations ranging from early-stage startups to globally distributed teams of 50+.

My most relevant experience is leading engineering in environments where security compliance is not optional. At ilumed, I architected a platform for 99.9% uptime while leading the SOC2/HITRUST certification process — establishing security controls, compliance frameworks, and audit preparation from the ground up. This required the same disciplined approach to security posture that your Cryptographic Posture Management and AI Security Posture Management products demand of your customers. I understand what it means to build systems where security is a first-class architectural concern, not an afterthought.

Beyond security, I bring a track record of scaling engineering organizations and delivering under ambiguity. I have built three separate engineering teams from inception — 22 at MedQuest, 15 at Red Spot Interactive, and 10 at Perceptive Solutions — each time hiring the initial engineers, developing engineering managers, establishing standards, and building the delivery processes that turned a small team into a scalable function. At Cognizant, I led 50+ engineers across three countries through a monolith-to-microservices transformation on AWS, balancing delivery speed against architectural rigor. These are the exact trade-offs this role requires: owning delivery and quality while building the team structures to sustain it.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building engineering organizations in security-regulated industries could accelerate the Cybersecurity Group's product delivery at SandboxAQ.

Sincerely,

Jimmy Rhoades
