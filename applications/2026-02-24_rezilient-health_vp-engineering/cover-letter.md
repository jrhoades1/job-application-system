Rezilient Health

Dear Hiring Manager,

Rezilient Health's hybrid care model — combining technology-enabled clinics with virtual care to deliver affordable primary and multispecialty care — addresses the exact problem I have spent my career solving: making healthcare systems work better through technology. As a CTO and engineering leader with 20 years in healthtech, I am writing to express my strong interest in the VP of Engineering role.

My most relevant experience is building healthcare platforms from the ground up while navigating the compliance and interoperability challenges that define this industry. At ilumed, I lead the technology strategy for a value-based care provider, where I overhauled the platform architecture for HIPAA compliance (achieving 99.9% uptime), drove SOC2/HITRUST certification readiness, and integrated AI/ML into clinical workflows that expanded beneficiary coverage from 50,000 to 90,000. Before that, I built three separate engineering teams from inception — scaling to 22 at MedQuest, 15 at Red Spot Interactive, and 10 at Perceptive Solutions — each time establishing the technical culture, hiring pipelines, and delivery processes that a growing organization requires.

What differentiates me from other engineering leaders is the combination of deep healthcare domain expertise and hands-on AI integration experience. I have worked with HL7, FHIR, and EHR systems throughout my career, not as a recent addition to my skill set but as a core part of every platform I have built. I have also integrated AI/ML into production healthcare systems at multiple companies — reducing development cycles by 30% at Perceptive, cutting operational costs by 18% at Red Spot, and driving measurable patient outcome improvements at ilumed — well before it became an industry trend. For a company scaling nationally and partnering with health systems and payers, this combination of compliance rigor, interoperability fluency, and AI capability is difficult to find in a single leader.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building and scaling healthcare engineering teams could support Rezilient Health's growth. I am particularly interested in the architectural challenges of scaling a hybrid care platform and the opportunity to build a team that can deliver on that vision.

Sincerely,

Jimmy Rhoades
