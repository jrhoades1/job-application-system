What is senior living?
Senior living encompasses a range of housing and care options for older adults, from senior apartments and independent living communities for active seniors to nursing homes for those with significant medical needs. Determining who needs senior living and what type of community they should live in depends on how much care they need:
Senior apartments and independent living communities:
The senior meets community age requirements and doesn’t need any care services.
Home care and assisted living communities:
The senior needs help with a couple of activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and eating, but is otherwise independent.
Memory care:
The senior has symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, and they need help with ADLs.
Nursing homes:
The senior needs skilled medical care for short-term or long-term conditions.
The costs and amenities of each community usually depend on the level of care provided and whether or not residents are given a maintenance-free, all-inclusive experience. Each senior living option is detailed below to help you find the best community for your needs.
What are the types of senior living?
Senior living options range from senior apartments and other 55+ communities to nursing homes. The biggest difference between each option is the level of care they provide to residents.
For independent seniors who don’t need assistance, senior apartments or independent living may be the right fit. Active seniors who need help with
activities of daily living
(ADLs) may strike a balance of independence and support in assisted living communities or board and care homes. However, seniors with complex health conditions or a form of dementia may benefit more from memory care communities or nursing homes.
Depending on the needs of the senior, home care or home health care may be a good fit. Home care services can provide companionship and daily support, while home health care services can offer prescribed in-home skilled nursing care.

Signs it's time for senior living
There are a variety of reasons someone may choose to move to senior living or employ a home care provider. For independent seniors, the desire to downsize or simplify expenses may indicate that it’s time to consider senior living. If a senior begins to have a decline in activities of daily living (ADLs), receives a dementia diagnosis, or has a complex medical condition requiring regular care, it may be time to consider more involved senior care. Look for options that provide health services, such as assisted living, memory care, nursing homes, and home health care.

Senior living costs and payment options
Typically, the more specialized a senior living option is, the more it will cost. For example, nursing homes remain the most expensive senior living option while offering the highest level of care possible outside of a hospital setting. Other features like location, care type, floor plan, services and amenities, and pricing model will affect the monthly cost of senior care.
Knowing what real families paid for care options can help you better plan for care and understand your budget. Below, you’ll see the monthly median senior living costs across the nation based on data from

.
When it comes time to cover the costs of senior care, families use both private and public pay options. Private payment methods include using funds from personal accounts, retirement savings, social security, and insurance. Some families may use public pay options, like Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans benefits.
