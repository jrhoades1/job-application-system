ork From Anywhere
A Dynamic and Flexible Workplace
At DrFirst, the concept of remote work isn’t new. In fact, some of our staff have worked remotely for over 20 years. However, the world has changed dramatically in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and companies today are mapping their course as in-office, hybrid, or “remote-first.”
While many companies are requiring employees to return to the office, at least some of the time, we are choosing a remote-first approach because of the benefits for the company and our people.
