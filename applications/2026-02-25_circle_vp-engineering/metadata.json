    "overall": "good",
    "requirements_matched": [
      "15+ years software engineering including 8+ years senior leadership — 20+ years experience, 10+ years at CTO/VP/Director/Chief Architect level",
      "Strong technical background building large-scale distributed systems — Monolith-to-microservices transformation (Cognizant), 99.9% uptime platform (ilumed), multi-cloud architecture (Red Spot)",
      "Balance long-term platform strategy with near/mid-term execution — Multi-quarter roadmaps (ilumed), aligned technical roadmaps with business needs (Red Spot), strategic + delivery across all roles",
      "Experience partnering with Product and cross-functional executives — CTO-level executive partnership at ilumed and Red Spot, cross-functional collaboration with product/clinical/ops at every company",
      "Passion for developing leaders, building teams, culture of accountability — Built 3 teams from zero, mentored engineers increasing velocity 15%, cultivated high-performing culture delivering 4 launches annually",
      "Experience leading globally distributed teams — Managed 50+ developers across US, Ukraine, and Central America (Cognizant), offshore resources at MedQuest and Red Spot",
      "Comfort operating in fast-paced environments with autonomy — Three startup builds from zero, CTO-level autonomy at ilumed and Red Spot",
      "Background in regulated, security-sensitive, compliance-heavy environments (preferred) — HIPAA compliance, SOC2/HITRUST certification, security architecture across entire career",
      "Experience scaling platforms in high-growth companies (preferred) — Expanded platform from 50K to 90K users (ilumed), 200K+ transactions (Red Spot), 100 centers in 13 states (MedQuest)"
    ],
    "requirements_partial": [
      "Managing leaders of leaders (directors and senior managers) — Led large orgs (22 at MedQuest with QA/Product leads, 50+ at Cognizant) but explicit director-of-directors experience not prominently documented. Has managed team leads and sub-team managers but not clearly at the directors-managing-directors level this role requires",
      "Leading platform or infrastructure engineering in product-centric environment — Built product platforms but not internal developer platforms or shared infrastructure services specifically. The distinction between product engineering and platform engineering matters here",
      "Expertise running critical high-traffic platforms (observability, scaling, incident response, reliability engineering) — 99.9% uptime and DevOps/CI/CD demonstrate operational excellence, but formal SRE practices, observability tooling, and incident response frameworks not specifically documented",
      "Building internal developer platforms or shared services (preferred) — No documented experience building internal developer tooling or platform-as-a-service for other engineering teams"
    ],
    "gaps": [
      "Fintech/blockchain/crypto domain — No financial services, digital assets, or blockchain experience",
      "Platform engineering vs product engineering — Role is specifically about product-enabling platforms (internal infrastructure), not customer-facing products. This is a distinct engineering discipline",
      "Scale of leadership — VP1 leading through directors and senior managers implies managing an org of 100+ engineers. Jimmy's largest direct org was 22 (MedQuest) and 50+ in a matrix at Cognizant. This is a step up in organizational scale"

    "addressable_gaps": [
      "Fintech/blockchain domain — Preferred, not required. The role is about platform engineering leadership, not domain expertise. Compliance-heavy background transfers well to regulated fintech",
      "Platform engineering — Has built foundational infrastructure (microservices, APIs, CI/CD pipelines) that other teams build on. The formal 'platform engineering' framing is different but the technical work overlaps"
    ],
    "hard_gaps": [
      "Organizational scale — VP1 at a 1,390-person NYSE company leading through directors is a significant step up from CTO at a small company or Chief Architect in a consulting role. The span of control (likely 100+ engineers across multiple platform domains) exceeds documented experience. Circle may see this as a stretch for someone who hasn't operated at this organizational scale before."
